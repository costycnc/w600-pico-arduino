# w600-pico-arduino

I have arduino ide 2.0.2 and additional board manager http://arduino.winnermicro.com/arduino/package_wmcom_index.json 

Board manager alternative on my site www.costycnc.it https://www.costycnc.it/arduino/package_wmcom_index.json (because i see that some times the original link not working)

Also i save https://www.costycnc.it/arduino/w600-arduino-0.2.6.zip and https://www.costycnc.it/arduino/wmtools-0.3.2.zip and insert in                                                       C:\Users\yourpc\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages  but idont know how make working this

also  i see that if I succeed to install package ... give me a little error ... but after install from https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads

the https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu/12.2.rel1/binrel/arm-gnu-toolchain-12.2.rel1-mingw-w64-i686-arm-none-eabi.exe  

when install check set environment variables ... the error when compiled dissapear but give error when need to upload code to w600

So ... for now i use tool.exe from https://github.com/vshymanskyy/w600tool/releases/tag/0.1 to upload code to w600

         Check in arduino "Show verbose output during x compile and will see the location of img file 
         
 In folder upload from above i create a batch file for windows as example
